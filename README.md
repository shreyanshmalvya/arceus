<p align = center><b><em>FPV based Drone Simulator</b></em></p>

**PROJECT ARCEUS** is drone simulator which models real world environment and payload constraints and helps pilots train against multiple terrain and climate conditions.The integrated LMS monitors the flying patterns and builds a personalized training module for every pilot . Alternatively the pilot could manually tweak the environment variables and train against diverse climate conditions , wind speeds etc. They could also tweak payload parameters and get real time insights about their flying patterns.

The pilots can utilize these data points to track progress and benchmark their ability . The vendors could use these data points to significantly reduce the risks of operating human-piloted UAVs
